                My kindred spirit, Earl is a vagabonding nomad backpacker like myself. We both love budget travel, backpacking, blogging, and everything in between (and yes, we’re good friends in real life too). I read Earl’s blog because he goes to places few people ever visit (Kurdistan, anyone?) and tells raw, honest travel stories that don’t sugarcoat the travel experience. Very few blogs do that, and for that, I think he’s one of the best travel websites out there. I’ve been reading him for years and he deserves a feature!
